#introduction

Taiwan has been surrounded by mountains and rivers since ancient times. Since at least the 16th century, most of the Taiwanese people have relied on the sea for their livelihood. Today, Taiwan is a big fishing country. Therefore, since ancient times, the coastal waters have been overfished, resulting in no fish in the coastal waters. Today, Taiwan has become the overlord of ocean fishing. There are three, one, no fish in the offshore area, two, technological progress, and three, ecological conservation; Taiwan's coastline accounts for 1/400 of the world's coastline, and fish species account for 1/10, and the resources are extremely rich. The technology developed by this team is for the conservation of marine ecology. developed by exhaustion.

This counting technology can use fixed space and long-term time for ecological analysis. For example, the team conducted data verification by CUC in the Shilang diving area of ​​Green Island, collected data in 2022/03, and collected data in 2022/06, separated by 3 Monthly, calculate whether the number of organisms in the same area increases or decreases. If the decrease is caused by a large amount of rain in the rainy season, the salinity of the coastal area decreases. If it increases, it may be due to many factors such as the predators of the organism leaving the area. , so this technology (CUC) is one of the key technologies, and it must also be matched with environmental data (analyzing long-term changes in salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH value and other data), expert knowledge (biology, meteorology, water quality, geology and other professional knowledge) and Only big data analysis can complete underwater ecological analysis.

This technology is CUC, which is one of the basic technologies of Marine Ecological Environment analysis.

The CUC can be counted through different creature training data, this version only provides lobster

This work was supported in part by the AI Research Center (AIRC), National Taiwan Ocean University, and in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST) AI Biomedical Research Center under Grant MOST 110-2634-F-019-002-, and Grant MOST 110-2221-E-019-062-.


This is the result of the development of CUC and Detector technology (continuously updated)

Detector uses Faster RCNN (will update YOLOv5 and EfficientDET)
